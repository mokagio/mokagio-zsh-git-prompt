zsh_git_prompt
==============

A simple script to visualize the status of the git repo in the current directory directly on the [zsh](git@github.com:mokagio/zsh-moka-aliases.git) prompt.

**Note** this is still a work in progress. I'll add pictures later on.

###Usage

Simply `source` the `zsh_git_prompt.zsh` file in your `.zshrc`.
